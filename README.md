1)This neural network architecture implements back-propogation algorithm to classify between different fruits.

2)The image is first converted to grayscale image and then converted to binary form.

3)The presentation slides prepared by me gives the overview of the project:

 4)How to use:
        
        -first select fruits you have to classify.
        
        -make sure that the fruits are of different shapes as the feature extracted from the image is its shape.
        
        -also ive put 5 neurons in the single middle layer of neurons. You can increase it if you increase the output classes or/and the number of inputs.
        
        -its better if the number of inputs is small as the network gets easily converged.
        
        -if you guys are wondering, the inputs is the number of pixels.
        
        -install required libraries and set the correct location for your training and testing images.
        
5)Execute and enjoy !!!
